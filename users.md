# Starlark implementations, tools, and users

## Implementations

The implementations below are not fully compliant to the specification yet. We
aim to remove the differences and provide a
[common test suite](https://github.com/bazelbuild/starlark/tree/master/test_suite).

*   in Go: https://github.com/google/starlark-go/
*   in Java:
    https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/tree/master/src/main/java/net/starlark/java
*   in Rust: https://github.com/google/starlark-rust/

## Tools

* [Buildifier](https://github.com/bazelbuild/buildtools): Code formatter &
  linter. It can also apply automated fixes (e.g. remove unused loads).
* [Stardoc](https://skydoc.bazel.build/): Documentation generator.
* [Starlark Playground](https://github.com/qri-io/starpg): Starlark Playground
  is a web-based starlark editor. It uses the golang implementation of starlark
  running on a server to present a monaco editor set to python syntax.

## IDEs

Some IDEs have a [plugin for Bazel](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/ide.html).
Otherwise, consider using a Python mode.

## Users

*  [Bazel](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel) is a fast, scalable,
   multi-language and extensible build system. Starlark has been designed for
   Bazel.
*  [Buck](https://buckbuild.com/) is a build system from Facebook, using
   Starlark in a similar way as Bazel.
*  [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) is a fast, cross-platform HTTP/2 web
   server with automatic HTTPS.
   [Starlark is used](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/tree/v2#json-is-declarative-what-if-i-need-more-programmability-ie-imperative-syntax)
   in Caddy 2 to extend the JSON configuration and add some logic.
*  [Copybara](https://github.com/google/copybara) is a tool for transforming and
   moving code between repositories. It embeds Starlark to configure the workflow.
*  [Delve](https://github.com/go-delve/delve) is a debugger for the Go
   programming language, aiming to provide a simple, full featured debugging
   tool for Go. [Delve uses Starlark](https://github.com/go-delve/delve/blob/master/Documentation/cli/starlark.md)
   as a a scripting language.
*  [Drone](https://drone.io) is a self-service Continuous Delivery platform. It
   supports [Starlark scripting](https://docs.drone.io/starlark/overview/) as an
   alternate to yaml configurations.
*  [Isopod](https://github.com/cruise-automation/isopod) created by Cruise
   Automation is a DSL framework for Kubernetes configuration. It renders
   Kubernetes objects as Protocol Buffers.
*  [lucicfg](https://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/luci/luci-go/+/refs/heads/master/lucicfg/doc/README.md)
   from Chromium CI is a tool for generating low-level configuration files from Starlark.
*  [qri](http://qri.io/) is versioned, scriptable, exportable,
   collaborative datasets. It uses Starlark to [describe transformations](https://qri.io/docs/reference/starlark_syntax/).
*  [Skycfg](https://github.com/stripe/skycfg) is a library for Starlark to
   generate Protocol Buffer messages.
*  [starlark-go-nethttp](https://github.com/pcj/starlark-go-nethttp) is a wrapper
   around a minimal subset of `net/http package` for use within starlark-go.
*  [Starlight](https://github.com/starlight-go/starlight) is a wrapper around the
   Starlark interpreter in Go.
*  [Tilt](https://tilt.dev/) manages local development instances for teams that
   deploy to Kubernetes. [Tilt files](https://docs.tilt.dev/tiltfile_concepts.html)
   are written in Starlark.
*  [ytt](https://get-ytt.io/) is a templating tool, built on top of Starlark,
   that understands YAML structure allowing you to focus on your data instead of
   how to properly escape it. Read also [IBM's blog post](
   https://developer.ibm.com/blogs/yaml-templating-tool-to-simplify-complex-configuration-management/)
   about it.
